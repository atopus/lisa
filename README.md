# Lisa

Lisa is a two-fold side-project :

1. In the foreground, it is designed to help a high school student monitor his mood and habits, and eventually get a solid basis of best learning practices.
2. In the background, it is a basic playground (as simple as a todo app) intended to explore and get acquainted with the core features of a react native. It aims at being a state-of-the-art app, including full test & documentation.

## Features

Lisa is a one-screen mobile app that records numeric variables on a day-to-day basis, along with a few generic dimensions :

* self-consciousness ;

and along the main knowledge fields, like :
