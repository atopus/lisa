# Liska

Liska is a two-fold side-project :

1. In the foreground, it is designed to help a high school student monitor his mood and habits, and eventually get a solid basis of best learning practices.
2. In the background, it is a basic playground (as simple as a todo app) intended to explore and get acquainted with the core features of a react native. It aims at being a state-of-the-art app, including full test & documentation.

## Features

Liska is a mobile app that records numeric and ordinal variables on a day-to-day basis.

## Setup

create-react-native-app has been used to create the repo. 

1. git clone this repo, 
2. Inside of the project folder, run `yarn install`, then `yarn start` ;
3. Download Expo on your device, and flash the QR code.

## Changelog

* 0.1 : Basic implementation with ordinal variables ;
* 0.2 : Add numerical variables support, drag and drop dimension sorting, redux migration capabilities

## Roadmap

These features are somewhere in the roadmap :
